You can run this code by pasting it to "Chrome Developer Tools console" and then pressing enter.

Some assumptions I made:
Stories section was not present in the website therefore, I placed my application after the banner.
Application uses JQuery and installs it if it is not available.
Lower price is always the current price amongst product.price and product.original_price.
I filled the whole circle when pressing favorite button because "filled-heart" svg was not present in the website.
